Importing the dataset
```{r}
bank <- read.csv("bank.csv",header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```


```{r}
summary(bank)
```

```{r}
str(bank)
```
Here we have 4521 observations and 17 variables in the data set. 

Let us check for NA's and blank spaces
```{r}
colSums(is.na(bank))
colSums(bank =="")
```
There is no missing values in the data set

1. age Vs y
Minimum of age is 19 maximum is 87 and mean age is 41.17
