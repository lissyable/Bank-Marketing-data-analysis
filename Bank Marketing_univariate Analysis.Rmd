Importing the dataset
```{r}
bank <- read.csv("bank.csv",header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```


```{r}
summary(bank)
```

```{r}
str(bank)
```
Here we have 4521 observations and 17 variables in the data set. 

Let us check for NA's and blank spaces
```{r}
colSums(is.na(bank))
colSums(bank =="")
```
There is no missing values in the data set

1. age(age of the customer)
```{r}
summary(bank$age)
```
minimum of age is 19 maximum is 87 and mean age is 41.17
Now visualize the data
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(bank, aes(x=age)) +labs(title="age") +
  geom_density(aes(fill = age), alpha = 0.5)
```
Most of the customers are from 30 to 40

2.job(Type of job). There are 12 type of job catagories.
```{r}
table(bank$job)
prop.table(table(bank$job))
```

Now visualize it
```{r}
ggplot(bank, aes(x = job, fill = job)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = prop.table(..count..) * 100), position='dodge') +
  geom_text(aes(y = prop.table(..count..) * 100 + 0.5, 
                  label = paste0(round(prop.table(..count..) * 100, 2), '%')), 
              stat = 'count', 
              position = position_dodge(.9), 
              size = 3) +

There is class imbalance so 88% customers didn't subscribed a deposit and 11% subscribed a deposit.

Correlation matrix

```{r}

for(i in 1:ncol(bank_cor)){
  
  bank_cor[,i]<- as.integer(bank_cor[,i])
}

corrplot(cor(bank_cor))
```
pdays, previous and poutcome are highly correlated variables
