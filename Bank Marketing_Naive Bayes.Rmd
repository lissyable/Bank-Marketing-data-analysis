This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


Importing the dataset
```{r}
bank <- read.csv("bank.csv",header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```


```{r}
summary(bank)
```


```{r}
str(bank)
```

The new bank dataset after removing age, job, previous, default, pdays, balance

```{r}
bank <- bank[c(3:4, 7:13, 16:17)]
str(bank)
bank$campaign <- as.factor(bank$campaign)
```
Check for normality of duration
```{r}
hist(bank$duration)
plot(density(bank$duration))
shapiro.test(bank$duration)
qqnorm(bank$duration);qqline(bank$duration, col = 2)
```

Check for normality of day
```{r}
hist(bank$day)
plot(density(bank$day))
shapiro.test(bank$day)
qqnorm(bank$day);qqline(bank$day, col = 2)
```

```{r}
for(i in 1 : nrow(bank))
{
  if (bank$duration[i] < 240)
  {
    bank$duration[i] = '00 to 04 min'
  }
  else if (bank$duration[i] < 480 & bank$duration[i] > 240)
  {
    bank$duration[i] = '04 to 08 min'
  } 
  else if (bank$duration[i] < 720 & bank$duration[i] > 480)
  {
    bank$duration[i] = '08 to 12 min'
  } 
  else if (bank$duration[i] < 960 & bank$duration[i] > 720)
  {
    bank$duration[i] = '12 to 16 min'
  }
  else if (bank$duration[i] < 1200 & bank$duration[i] > 960)
  {
    bank$duration[i] = '16 to 20 min'
  }
  else if (bank$duration[i] < 1440 & bank$duration[i] > 1200)
  {
    bank$duration[i] = '20 to 24 min'
  }
  else if (bank$duration[i] < 1680 & bank$duration[i] > 1440)
  {
    bank$duration[i] = '24 to 28 min'
  }
  else if (bank$duration[i] < 1920 & bank$duration[i] > 1680)
  {
    bank$duration[i] = '28 to 32 min'
  }
  else if (bank$duration[i] < 2160 & bank$duration[i] > 1920)
  {
    bank$duration[i] = '32 to 36 min'
  }
  else if (bank$duration[i] > 2160)
  {
    bank$duration[i] = ' >  36  min '
  }
}
```
 
```{r}
bank$duration <- as.factor(bank$duration)
table(bank$duration)
```
 
```{r}
for(i in 1 : nrow(bank))
{
  if (bank$day[i] < 7)
  {
    bank$day[i] = '1st week'
  }
  else if (bank$day[i] < 14 & bank$day[i] > 7)
  {
    bank$day[i] = '2nd week'
  } 
  else if (bank$day[i] < 21 & bank$day[i] > 14)
  {
    bank$day[i] = '3rd week'
  } 
  else if (bank$day[i] < 28 & bank$day[i] > 21)
  {
    bank$day[i] = '4th week'
  }
  
  else if (bank$day[i] > 28)
  {
    bank$day[i] = '5th week'
  }
}
```
 
```{r}
bank$day <- as.factor(bank$day)
table(bank$day)
```
 
 Splitting the dataset into training set and test set
```{r}
# install.packages("caTools")
library(caTools)
set.seed(123)
split = sample.split(bank$y, SplitRatio = 2/3)
training_set = subset(bank, split == TRUE)
test_set = subset(bank, split == FALSE)
```

Fitting classifier to the training test
```{r}
# install.packages("e1071")
library(e1071)
classifier = naiveBayes(y ~ ., data = training_set)
print(classifier)
```

Predicting the test results
```{r}
y_pred = predict(classifier, newdata = test_set)
y_pred
```
Confusion matrix
```{r}
cm = table(test_set$y, y_pred)
cm
```
Accuracy is the ratio of correctly predicted observation to the total observations
```{r}
accuracy <- sum(diag(cm))/sum(cm) 
accuracy
```
 So we got 89% accuracy
Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations.
```{r}
precision <- cm[2,2]/(sum(cm[,2]))
precision
```
We got 56% precision
Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations in actual class
```{r}
recall <- cm[2,2]/(sum(cm[2,]))
recall
```
We got 25% recall

```{r}
F1 <- 2*(recall * precision) / (recall + precision)
F1
```

 34% is the F1 score
